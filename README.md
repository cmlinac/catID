# catID

I wanted to learn more about machine learning, computer vision, convolutional neural networks, deep learning etc. so I decided to train a model to recognize which of my cats is which. I added an iOS app that, using the trained model, uses the camera and shows which cat it thinks is present and a confidence percentage.

The first model I trained worked pretty well considering I only used 250 pictures of each cat. I'm currently adding more data, as well as adding a third category for when neither cat is present.
